# Web layer
Responsible for exposing our data (filtered by enterprise and business logic) in the web.

For example, if we're using Spring Web, the logic will be contained here.


In this case, we will be using Ktor web framework to handle http requests. So this will be the 'Frameworks and drivers' part from clean architecture.
